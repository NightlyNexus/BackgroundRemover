Background Remover
=====================

Easily remove the background from pictures. Create stickers or batch scan cards.

Background Remover takes any image and creates a png of only the foreground of the image with alpha transparency for the background. You can even select many images and create new background-less copies in one click.

Background Remover runs extremely fast all on only your device’s local CPU using Google’s latest ML Kit.

I use it to make digital scans of tiles and cards from board games.
